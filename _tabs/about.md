## Zanna Bear
Zanna Bear or *Seashell Bear* lives in The Hague, The Netherlands with her husband and two children. She loves the sea but hates the sand (it’s coarse and it gets everywhere). 
Storytelling is her passion. She shares her love for the fantasy genre not only through books, but also through TTRPGs like Dungeons&Dragons and LARP. 
Her hobbies include drawing fantasy maps, quilting, crocheting, embroidering and messing about in the vegetable garden. 

Under Seashell Bear Creative – this website and her instagram – you can find all her produced creative projects.
