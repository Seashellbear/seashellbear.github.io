## Zanna Bear
Zanna Bear lives in The Hague, The Netherlands with her husband and two children. She loves the sea but hates the sand (itâ€™s coarse and it gets everywhere). 
Storytelling is her passion. She shares her love for the fantasy genre not only through books, but also through TTRPGs like Dungeons&Dragons and LARP. 
Her hobbies include drawing fantasy maps, quilting, crocheting, embroidering and messing about in the vegetable garden.
