I'm beyond excited to anounce the release of my debut novel **Three of Cups**.   
  
## Three of Cups

*What if life itself was the adventure?*  
  
Rose has always wanted to be a bard, a musician who inspires emotions by infusing her song with just a thread of magic. The course seems clear: attend bardic college in Splendor, the biggest city in the realm, and complete their four-year degree programme.  
It seems easy enough. But nothing is ever that straightforward, is it?  
  
Along the way to Splendor, Rose meets Bosra, a grey-skinned giant-kin woman who is leaving her adventuring days behind her. Most adventurers don't retire; they either die as heroes or become villains. She intends to start a new life in the busiest and biggest place she knows: the city of Splendor.   
  
Valentina is contemplating whether there is more to life than her accustomed luxuries and limitations as a princess – when Bosra and Rose find respite in the coffee shop she frequents most afternoons. One conversation leads to another, and before she knows it, she's encouraged to step out of her gilded cage… 
Until the powerful people who built the cage come to drag her back.  
  
  
**Three of Cups** is a low stakes, high fantasy novel centered around the sisterhood of found family.
