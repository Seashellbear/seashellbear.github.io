# The Wellspring Dungeon
I proudly present my first adventure available on the [Dungeon Masters Guild](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/467504/The-Wellspring-Dungeon?affiliate_id=1416947 "The Wellspring Dungeon") website.  
This D&D 5e adventure is ideal for 4-6 characters of seventh level.

This dungeon contains a fun series of puzzles intended to challenge the players at your table to creatively solve the problems they pose. 

The puzzles are variations on the classics - Stairs turns into slide, Mission Impossible, the Acid and Spike Pit - followed by a cool and challenging boss fight.

The Well that the city has been built on and is its main water supply, has been poisoned. And not just with any toxin, but something that causes any drinker of the water to go into a berserker rage for an extended period of time. 

Itâ€™s only a few more days until Founding Day, the most important festival of the year, when water is shared amongst the citizenry directly from the well and the normally closed-off inhabitants go out into the streets to share food, drink and stories with their neighbors.

Will the heroes who brave this dungeon be successful in saving the festival and the city?
