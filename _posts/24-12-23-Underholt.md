# Underholt

A small fortress on a hill, in the bend of a river.
Whether they are hunting hags, or merely travelling the lands, the heroes approach Kolbinsholt. Little do they know what lies beneath. 

Are the heroes prepared to delve into the underground lair of a powerful hag? Will they defeat her? 

Or shall the hag add new souls to her collection? 

Underholt offers a challenge to experienced players (and DMs) as the heroes set out to confront the night hag Sakernacht in her true lair. 

This adventure was written for 4-6 well-geared 7th level characters, and allows them freedom in exploring the dungeon. The boss encounter is pointed towards a more difficult encounter, for a party that has their combat tactics down. 

Includes handdrawn maps to all dungeon locations.
